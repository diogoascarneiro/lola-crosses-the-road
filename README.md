# About

This game was created while studying at Ironhack Lisbon in under two weeks, and was the first individual project developed there. The requirements were to use JS, DOM Manipulation and HTML Canvas to create a game of our choosing. Since I happen to be the happy pet parent of a four-legged princess / drama queen that I taught not to cross any road without permission, the choice was clear. I mean, just look at her.

Soon the ideas came flooding into my brain - game mechanics, easter eggs, concentration bars, a dog treat-based score system... but alas, I only had two weeks to do this. So the multi-title franchise that would catapult my dog into the homes and hearts of gamers everywhere suddenly became...a Frogger clone. And you know what? That's pretty cool too.

# Some features I'd like to add in the future
* Animations - I have assets to animate Lola's movement but sadly did not have time to implement this - same with the people walking around randomly;
* Better person AI - People walk a bit like headless chickens at the moment. I have made them susceptible to being run over by cars as punishment for their digital sins, but it is I as their creator who is to blame. As a benevolent deity, I at least ought to make them cross roads faster and have a more steady, determined walk (while keeping it somewhat random).
* A map generator - there's a function to generate roads with different numbers of crosswalks and I'd like to do the same for other objects
* An "Owner" npc that tells Lola when to cross or stay! Following instructions would earn her "treats" (points) while failing to do so would make her lose them. 
* ...and a million other things
